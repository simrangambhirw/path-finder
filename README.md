# path-finder
A program that finds a path from the entrance chamber to all the treasure chambers.
As the path is being computed, the following constraints must be satisfied: 
• if the program has a choice between moving into a treasure chamber or a chamber without a treasure your program must prefer the treasure chamber 
• if the program has a choice between moving to a lighted chamber or moving to a dim chamber the program must prefer the lighted chamber.
